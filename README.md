The application runs for iOS devices so please make sure that you have Xcode downloaded before the first time you run and that your iOS device is plugged in via USB to your machine. When the application opens it will take you to the start screen. When you presss the start button the app will open to you camera view where it is expectign to scan an image so that it can overlay the virtual environment.  You can find the current tracked image to print at Assets/_UFO Game/Textures/Markers/pokemon_card_backside_in_high_resolution_by_atomicmonkeytcg_dah43cy-pre.png. 
When the game starts the  UFO  object will appear overhead. If caught in the target curor below, the user will be 'beamed up' into the UFO and the game will end. Pressing the 'Beam' in th  bottom right corner halts the movement of the UFO and can also be used to beam up the sheep objects. If the user can beam up all the sheep before they are caught by the UFO they win.
